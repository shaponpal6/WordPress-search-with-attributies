# WordPress-search-with-attributies

This plugin is able to search regular product attributes or meta data. But attributes must be string type not php serialized object.

You can't search php serialized object by SQL Query.

If you need to search php serialized object, i also can do this.

Add attributes (like mobile_brand "iPhone") from product edit page and search

Or Search Meta data of post
